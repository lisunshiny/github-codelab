        <p>
          I see trees of green... red roses too I see 'em bloom... for me and
          for you And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see skies of blue... and clouds of white Bright blessed days....
          warm sacred nights And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colors of a rainbow... so pretty in the sky Are also on the
          faces... of people going by I see friends shaking hands.....sayin'..
          how do you do? They're really sayin'... I love you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hear babies cry... I watch them grow They'll learn much more... than
          I'll never know And I think to myself... what a wonderful world
        </p>
        <p>Yes, I think to myself... what a wonderful world...</p>
