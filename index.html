            <span style="font-weight: bold">A poem:</span><br/><br />
            A place of code and wit, where developers meet<br />
            To share their work and learn, to make it sweet<br />
            A community of sorts, where all are free<br />
            To join and share and learn, in harmony<br />
            <br />
            Github's open doors, a welcoming sight<br />
            For those who seek to code and make things right<br />
            A platform built for all, from newbies green<br />
            To experts old, a community unseen<br />
            <br />
            With every push and pull, with every fork<br />
            The code evolves, and knowledge starts to pour<br />
            In every line and branch, the story's told<br />
            Of how we work together, young and old<br />
            <br />
            So let us sing the praises of this place<br />
            Where code and community come together in grace<br />
            A haven for the curious mind<br />
            On Github, code of all kinds we shall find.<br />
